HowToPlaceShipsHeading: Placing your ships
HowToPlaceShipsFull: Before the actual game starts, you have to choose where to put your ships. To do so, you press the left mouse button in the first square of where you want to put your ship and release it in the last one. To delete one of your placed ships, just click it; you will then be able to put it somewhere else. The squares around your placed ships will become grey, as ships are not allowed to touch each other. It is also possible to let a random placement be generated.
HowToPlayHeading: Firing shots and moving ships
HowToPlayFull: After the initial placement phase, you and the computer take turns. Each move consists of firing shots (if the according option is set, you get to fire again as long as you are hitting your opponent's ships) and -optionally- moving one of your undamaged ships by one square. You fire your shot by just clicking the desired square in your opponent's field. Undamaged ships are marked; those which are movable (i.e. there is no obstacle in the way) have arrows at their ends. Just click one of the arrows to move a ship. Important: Once a ship is sunk, it disappears. This means that as soon as a ship is sunk, the other ships are able to move across it. 
ReallyFair: Does the computer play fair?
ReallyFairFull sourceURL@String: Yes, it does - When placing and moving its ships, it has to abide by the same rules as you. During the game it does not get any more information than you; there is a 'middleman' who controls the game. Just like you do, the computer decides on a square to fire at and tells the middleman its decision. The only information the computer gets in return is whether it hit / sunk a ship or just hit water. Besides, the computer cannot 'lie' about its ships, because the middleman knows where the computer's ships are at all times. After the game ends, you see an animated recap of the course of the game to comprehend what happened when. If you are extra paranoid, you may want to look at the source code (#{sourceURL}) to convince yourself that the computer does not cheat.
