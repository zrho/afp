# Applied Functional Programming

AFP was a class on web programming in Haskell with Yesod at the University of
Bonn in winter semester 2013/2014, supervised by [Janis Voigtl√§nder](http://www.iai.uni-bonn.de/~jv/). 6 students participated over the course of
the semester. The class was two-split in a seminar part with theory talks and
three practical browser game projects.

# Web Projects: Tic Tac Toe

The first project was a small Tic Tac Toe implementation, human vs. AI, and
was developed in teams of three. You can try out the results at [Team 1](http://www-pg.iai.uni-bonn.de/team1/tictactoe) and [Team 2](http://www-pg.iai.uni-bonn.de/team2/tictactoe).

# Web Projects: Battleships

The flagship project of the class, developed in one team of four, is an implementation of the popular game [battleships](http://www-pg.iai.uni-bonn.de/battleships). Lorem Ipsum
